Chili Pepper Faces
===========================

There have been some Red Hot Chili Peppers songs playing around the house here and there as we shelter in place. I don't love the Chili Peppers, but I do find myself with a line like "Ding dang dong dong ding dang dong dong ding dang" stuck in my head for hours, with a mix of annoyance and pervers glee. Maybe I am losing my mind.

I recall how in 2006, the great Nick Cave stated, "I’m forever near a stereo saying, ‘What the fuck is this garbage?’ And the answer is always the Red Hot Chili Peppers.”

I love Nick Cave, but I'm afraid that we can't let this insult stand. Open your mouth wide, raise your eyebrows, or purse your lips to hear some choice cuts and impress Nick Cave.
